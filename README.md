This is my README, it will contaion all the neccessary info relating to my project. My git repo consists of multiple files that are all part of a single website that i have created. I have committed to this repo regularly, resulting in a lovely yet scary website. 
This website demonstrates my competency in the use of fundamental components of web pages, basic/client server communication, programming languages and industry relevant tools and workflows.


SCARY WEBSITE - TYLOR BENNETT

My web application is essentially a website meant to scare the user. The are various spooky images and backgrounds to send chills down your spine. 
I have used CSS, JAVA SCRIPT and HTML in my website. These were all used to support each other and make the design more efficient instead of overlapping or having some features stand out over the others. 

Website Layout

Ive used a simple yet smooth structure when layout out my pages. I have a Header and a Footer that are always present, regardless of what page you are on. The Header has a navigation bar component combined into it. The Footer is combined into two parts, the footer words and the Footer images.
The words are 3 lists of scary items of horror. Games, movies and killers. The Footer images has an age rating and my website logo. Below the footer is a special surprise for any users who scroll down too far. The body consists of two parts, the intro and the gallery. 
I have a second page that links to a word in the nav bar. This page has more information in my website.

Styling 

I have used both css styling and in scope styling. I did this to maximise what i can do in web development. By doing so ive learned how to do both.


Fetching

I have fetched 2 blocks of API data in my code. One of them is a single image, and another is 12 images in rows. Both these fetches are in the same area of code. It fetches 2 sets of data and stores each of them in their own array. 

Bugs 

The website scales well, the only thing that does not scale is the into/first image on the page. I copuld not get the correvct styling without breaking my code. The image does not resize with the page, and instead removes the text next to it. The text next to it dissapears off the screen when the page gets too small. 

Features

The nav bar has two features. When the text 'More info'  is selected, it will take the user to another page. When the text 'click for terror' is selected it will send you to a google images link.

Future Feature 

i plan to add more user interaction to the websit. There will be a button that will generate a random scary sound effect. I will get this from an API. I also plan to have a page with scary stories. There will be a side button to swipe to the next story. 

How to run 

Copy the git hub lick into your git bash promt and clone the repo. 
Right click in the folder and open with visual studio code.
Type npm run dev -- --open ins the git bash terminal. If you do not have svelte downloaded, you need to download it first and then typ npm i to install.
